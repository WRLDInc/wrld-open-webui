- `generate-key.ps1` - Secret key generator

### 5. ✅ GitHub Repository Updated
- All configurations pushed to main branch
- Repository: https://github.com/WRLDInc/wrld-open-webui
- Ready for Coolify webhook integration

## 🚀 Next Steps in Coolify

### Quick Deployment Guide

1. **Access Coolify Dashboard**
   - Log into your Coolify instance
   - Navigate to your project

2. **Create Application**
   - New Resource → Docker Compose
   - Repository: `https://github.com/WRLDInc/wrld-open-webui`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Compose file: `docker-compose.coolify.yaml`

3. **Add Environment Variables**
   ```
   WEBUI_SECRET_KEY=e32c4d6483d699b168a00a81226b399e7463aa1bf714760bb13e4f177c3466de (mark as secret)
   OPEN_WEBUI_PORT=3000
   OLLAMA_DOCKER_TAG=latest
   WEBUI_DOCKER_TAG=main
   ```

4. **Deploy & Monitor**
   - Click Deploy
   - Watch build logs
   - Verify health checks

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

Run the provided test script:
```powershell
.\test-deployment.ps1 -AppUrl "https://your-domain.com"
```

Or manually test:
- Health endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/health`
- Main UI: `https://your-domain.com/`
- API Docs: `https://your-domain.com/docs`

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

After successful deployment:
- ✓ Application accessible via HTTPS
- ✓ Health checks passing (HTTP 200)
- ✓ Containers running (open-webui, ollama)
- ✓ Data persisting in volumes
- ✓ Monitoring metrics available
- ✓ Automatic deployments on git push (if webhook configured)

## 🔍 Key Files Reference

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docker-compose.coolify.yaml` | Main deployment configuration |
| `DEPLOYMENT_MONITORING.md` | Complete monitoring guide |
| `COOLIFY_NEXT_STEPS.md` | Deployment instructions |
| `test-deployment.ps1` | Health check testing |
| `generate-key.ps1` | Secret key generation |

## 📈 Monitoring Metrics

Configured monitoring for:
- Container health status
- Memory usage (limit: 2GB)
- CPU usage (limit: 2 cores)
- Volume storage utilization
- Health check response times
- Container restart events

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- ✅ Secret key generated and ready for secure storage
- ✅ CORS configuration included (update for production)
- ✅ Health checks configured for monitoring
- ✅ Resource limits set to prevent overuse
- ✅ Persistent volumes for data protection

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Secret Key**: Store the WEBUI_SECRET_KEY securely in Coolify as a secret variable
2. **Domain**: Update CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN for production domain
3. **Resources**: Adjust memory/CPU limits based on server capacity
4. **Backups**: Configure regular backups for persistent volumes
5. **Updates**: Set up webhook for automatic deployments

## 🎯 Deployment Readiness

**Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** ✅

All technical preparations are complete. The application can now be deployed through the Coolify dashboard following the instructions in `COOLIFY_NEXT_STEPS.md`.
